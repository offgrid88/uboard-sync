# uBoardSync

**uBoardSync** is a ROS 2 Humble node designed to manage micro-ROS agents for multiple boards seamlessly. It automatically detects new boards, creates and runs a ROS agent for each, monitors board statuses to stop agents upon disconnection, and manages udev rules for device identification. Additionally, it can monitor heartbeats from each board and restart agents if a heartbeat is not received. This tool simplifies the integration of multiple micro-ROS devices into your ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/offgrid88/uBoardSync.git
cd uBoardSync
```

### 2. Build the Package

Assuming you have a ROS 2 workspace set up:

```bash
cd ~/your_ros2_workspace/src
ln -s /path/to/uBoardSync .
cd ~/your_ros2_workspace
colcon build --packages-select uboardsync
```

### 3. Source the Workspace

```bash
source ~/your_ros2_workspace/install/setup.bash
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install any Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r uboardsync/requirements.txt
```

*Note: Ensure that `pip` installs packages for the Python version used by ROS 2.*

## Usage

### 1. Configure Boards

Edit the `boards_config.yaml` file to include your boards' information. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

### 2. Enable Heartbeat Functionality (Optional)

If you wish to use the heartbeat monitoring feature, ensure it's enabled in the configuration file. See the [Heartbeat Functionality](#heartbeat-functionality) section for details.

### 3. Run uBoardSync

```bash
ros2 run uboardsync uboard_sync_node
```

This command starts the uBoardSync node, which begins monitoring for connected boards as per your configuration.

## Configuration

The `boards_config.yaml` file holds the configuration for the boards you wish to manage. It should be located in the `config` directory of the package.

### Sample `boards_config.yaml`

```yaml
boards:
  - name: board_1
    pid: '0x2341'
    vid: '0x0043'
    serial_number: 'ABC12345'
    agent_port: '/dev/uboard_board_1'
    namespace: 'board_1_ns'
    heartbeat_topic: '/board_1/heartbeat'
    heartbeat_timeout: 5
  - name: board_2
    pid: '0x2341'
    vid: '0x0043'
    serial_number: 'DEF67890'
    agent_port: '/dev/uboard_board_2'
    namespace: 'board_2_ns'
    heartbeat_topic: '/board_2/heartbeat'
    heartbeat_timeout: 5
```

### Configuration Parameters

- **name**: A unique identifier for the board.
- **pid**: USB Product ID of the board (hexadecimal string, e.g., `'0x2341'`).
- **vid**: USB Vendor ID of the board (hexadecimal string, e.g., `'0x0043'`).
- **serial_number**: Serial number of the board (optional but recommended for precise identification).
- **agent_port**: The symlinked device path that udev will create (e.g., `'/dev/uboard_board_1'`).
- **namespace**: The ROS 2 namespace to be used by the agent.
- **heartbeat_topic**: (*Optional*) The topic on which the board publishes its heartbeat messages.
- **heartbeat_timeout**: (*Optional*) The time in seconds after which, if no heartbeat is received, the agent will be restarted.

## Heartbeat Functionality

When the heartbeat functionality is enabled, uBoardSync listens for heartbeat messages from each board on the specified `heartbeat_topic`. If no heartbeat is received within the `heartbeat_timeout` period, uBoardSync will automatically restart the agent associated with that board.

### Enabling Heartbeat Monitoring

To enable heartbeat monitoring for a board, add the `heartbeat_topic` and `heartbeat_timeout` parameters to the board's configuration in `boards_config.yaml`.

- **heartbeat_topic**: The ROS 2 topic where the board publishes its heartbeat messages. It should be unique per board.
- **heartbeat_timeout**: The duration in seconds to wait for a heartbeat before restarting the agent.

### Heartbeat Message Format

Boards should publish heartbeat messages on the specified `heartbeat_topic` using the `std_msgs/Empty` message type or any other type as per your implementation.

### Example Board Configuration with Heartbeat

```yaml
boards:
  - name: board_1
    pid: '0x2341'
    vid: '0x0043'
    serial_number: 'ABC12345'
    agent_port: '/dev/uboard_board_1'
    namespace: 'board_1_ns'
    heartbeat_topic: '/board_1/heartbeat'
    heartbeat_timeout: 5
```

## Udev Rule Manager

The udev rule manager automates the creation of udev rules to assign consistent device names (symlinks) based on PID and VID, and optionally the serial number.

### Setting Up Udev Rules

uBoardSync will attempt to set up udev rules automatically based on your configuration. Ensure you have the necessary permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

After modifying groups, you may need to log out and log back in.

### Manual Udev Rule Creation (Optional)

If automatic setup fails, you can manually create udev rules:

1. Create a udev rules file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uboard.rules
   ```

2. Add rules for your devices:

   ```udev
   SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTR{idProduct}=="2341", ATTR{idVendor}=="0043", ATTR{serial}=="ABC12345", SYMLINK+="uboard_board_1"
   SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTR{idProduct}=="2341", ATTR{idVendor}=="0043", ATTR{serial}=="DEF67890", SYMLINK+="uboard_board_2"
   ```

3. Reload udev rules:

   ```bash
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
   sudo udevadm trigger
   ```

## Topics

uBoardSync publishes the status of connected boards on ROS 2 topics:

- **`/uboardsync/connected_boards`** (`std_msgs/String`): Lists the names of currently connected boards.
- **`/uboardsync/board_status/<board_name>`** (`std_msgs/Bool`): Indicates whether a specific board is connected (`True`) or disconnected (`False`).
- **Heartbeat Topics**: Each board publishes heartbeat messages on its specified `heartbeat_topic`.

## Example

### Running the Node

After configuring your boards and enabling heartbeat functionality, run the node:

```bash
ros2 run uboardsync uboard_sync_node
```

### Monitoring Topics

You can check the connected boards:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /uboardsync/connected_boards
```

Monitor a specific board's status:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /uboardsync/board_status/board_1
```

### Simulating Heartbeat Messages

Ensure that each board publishes heartbeat messages on the specified `heartbeat_topic`. For testing purposes, you can publish heartbeat messages manually:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /board_1/heartbeat std_msgs/Empty
```

### Interacting with Agents

Agents for each board are namespaced as per your configuration. You can interact with them using standard ROS 2 tools.

### Heartbeat Failure and Agent Restart

If a board stops publishing heartbeat messages, uBoardSync will detect the absence of heartbeats after the `heartbeat_timeout` period and will restart the agent for that board.
